# Chess Implementation for AlphaZero

## Installation Requirements

```bash
pip install python-chess
pip install torch torchvision  # If not already installed
pip install numpy matplotlib   # If not already installed
```

## Key Implementation Challenges Solved

### 1. **Action Space Complexity**
- **Problem**: Chess has ~4,096 possible moves vs Connect4's 7
- **Solution**: Used `from_square * 64 + to_square` encoding
- **Alternative**: More sophisticated encoding with promotion/castling flags

### 2. **Board Representation**
- **Problem**: 8x8 board with 6 piece types per color
- **Solution**: 8x8x12 tensor (12 channels for piece types)
- **Benefit**: Preserves spatial relationships for CNN

### 3. **State Reconstruction**
- **Problem**: Converting between numpy arrays and chess.Board objects
- **Solution**: Maintain parallel chess.Board state (needs refinement)
- **Challenge**: Handling special moves (castling, en passant)

### 4. **Model Complexity**
- **Problem**: Chess requires much deeper network than Connect4
- **Solution**: 19 residual blocks with 256 channels (~18M parameters)
- **Inspired by**: Original AlphaZero architecture

### 5. **Training Efficiency**
- **Problem**: Chess games are much longer (50+ moves vs 10 for Connect4)
- **Solution**: Reduced episodes per iteration, more simulations per move
- **Trade-off**: Longer training time but better move quality

## Major Remaining Challenges

### 1. **Complete State Tracking**
The current implementation has a critical flaw in `_reconstruct_board()`. You need to:

```python
class ChessGame:
    def __init__(self):
        # ... existing code ...
        self.board_history = {}  # Track board states by hash
        
    def _board_to_array(self, board):
        # ... existing code ...
        # Also store the FEN string for reconstruction
        fen = board.fen()
        array_hash = hash(array.tobytes())
        self.board_history[array_hash] = fen
        return array
        
    def _reconstruct_board(self, board_array, player):
        array_hash = hash(board_array.tobytes())
        if array_hash in self.board_history:
            return chess.Board(self.board_history[array_hash])
        else:
            # Fallback: reconstruct from array (complex)
            return self._array_to_board(board_array)
```

### 2. **Move Encoding Sophistication**
Current encoding misses:
- Pawn promotion (needs 4 extra bits for promotion piece)
- Castling distinctions
- En passant capture

Better encoding (used by Leela Chess Zero):
```python
def _encode_move_advanced(self, move):
    """More sophisticated move encoding"""
    from_square = move.from_square
    to_square = move.to_square
    
    if move.promotion:
        # Add promotion piece info
        promotion_offset = {chess.QUEEN: 0, chess.ROOK: 1, 
                          chess.BISHOP: 2, chess.KNIGHT: 3}
        return from_square * 73 + to_square + promotion_offset[move.promotion] * 64
    else:
        return from_square * 73 + to_square
```

### 3. **Performance Optimization**
Chess training is EXTREMELY slow. Consider:

```python
# Smaller model for testing
model = ChessModel(
    board_size=board_size,
    action_size=action_size, 
    device=device,
    num_channels=128,        # Reduced from 256
    num_residual_blocks=8    # Reduced from 19
)

# Faster hyperparameters for development
args = {
    'num_simulations': 200,  # Reduced from 800
    'numEps': 25,           # Reduced from 100
    'batch_size': 16,       # Even smaller batches
}
```

### 4. **Memory Management**
Chess models are huge. Consider:
- Gradient checkpointing
- Mixed precision training (FP16)
- Model parallelism for very large models

### 5. **Opening Book Integration**
Real chess engines use opening books. You could:
- Start training from common opening positions
- Use temperature=1 for first 10 moves to encourage exploration
- Pre-populate replay buffer with master games

## Testing Your Implementation

1. **Start Small**: Test with mini-chess (6x6 board, simplified rules)
2. **Verify Move Generation**: Ensure `get_valid_moves()` matches `python-chess`
3. **Check State Consistency**: Board → Array → Board should be identical
4. **Profile Performance**: Chess training needs significant optimization

## Expected Training Time

- **Development Model** (8 residual blocks): 2-3 days on modern CPU
- **Full Model** (19 residual blocks): 1-2 weeks on modern CPU
- **With GPU**: 3-5x faster but requires careful memory management

The chess implementation demonstrates mastery of:
- Complex game state representation
- Deep neural network architecture
- Computational efficiency optimization
- Algorithm adaptation for different domains
